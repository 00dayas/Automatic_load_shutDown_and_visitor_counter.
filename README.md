# Automatic_load_shutDown_and_visitor_counter.
An Arduino-based system that cuts off the lamp loads of a room based on the number of people inside the room. This system also consists of a visitor counter which will actively monitor the number of people in the room.
This system was built during the pandemic period when there was a restriction on public gatherings and social events. This project has an inbuilt buzzer which will go on if the number of people entering the room exceeds the set limit.
